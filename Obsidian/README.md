# Obsidian Notes

The following shows an example of how to use Obsidian to organize a the pre-spec phase.

## Part 1

- First we create a sources folder and add in our problem statement. Then we create an MSML scaffold folder which we can use for scaffolding out some of our features. Then we begin marking up some of the text in Obsidian.
- When we read that there is one single person looking to retire, we can think about how this should be an entity in our simulation.
- The phrase "only have control over the allocation percentages at any given time between bonds and stocks" makes us think that maybe there is a wiring or control action but for now we are not sure so we link it to "TBD Allocation" which we will use to fill stuff in later.
- Likewise for "prices of the assets change", we have "TBD Asset Price Change" and for "returns of both stocks and bonds are assumed to be randomly distributed" we have "TBD Return Behavior"
- Finally, the parameters are pretty clear cut so we will just add them in. Not we actually have the symbols given so we will write them into the notes.
